<!--
Before opening a bug, please note that testing on the latest tag or commit is highly recommended.
Whether you run the latest commit or the latest tag isn't too important, but any other commits
or newer tags may already have fixed it, especially during the catchup phase of the plugin
development.

TL;DR: update before you continue, and check that you're able to verify it.

This template outlines a number of points. You're not required to follow this template,
but the bits mentioned in the template are required. If we're missing a clear description,
or steps to reproduce, or other important context, the issue may be closed until we get it.
