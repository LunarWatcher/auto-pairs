          # TL;DR:
          # Run helptags doc
          # If an error happens, the try-catch catches it. Echoerr v:exception then logs it
          # and aborts the rest of that command. If it doesn't error, the `qa` is executed,
          # and vim exits normally, resulting in the last -c not being executed.
          # The last -c is only executed if an error occurs, and cq is exiting vim with an error,
          # which causes the CI to observe teh error as well, and causing a proper CI failure.
          # Stonks!
          vim -c "try | helptags doc | catch | echoerr v:exception | endtry | qa" -c "cq"
