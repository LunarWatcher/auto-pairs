1. General troubleshooting                           *autopairs-troubleshooting*

This plugin remaps, among others, `([{'"}]) <BS> <CR>` . BS and CR can be
controlled by options in the plugin, but the rest are mapped based on what
pairs you're using. See |g:AutoPairs|

If auto pairs doesn't work, use |:verbose| |:imap| to check if the map is correct.

For i.e. `:verbose imap (`, the correct map is: >

    <C-R>=autopairs#AutoPairsInsert("(")<CR>

How do I insert a character registered as a part of a pair without~
                        triggering the plugin?~

There are four ways to do this:

    1. Use `Ctrl-V )` to insert an open or close character (where ")" is any
        open or close character) without trigger the plugin.

    2. Use `Alt-P` or `Ctrl-P Ctrl-T` to turn off the plugin. See
        |g:AutoPairsShortcutToggle|

    3. Use `DEL`, `<C-O>x`, or other "normal" means of deletion to delete the
        character inserted by the plugin.

    4. Use <C-p><C-e> (|g:AutoPairsShortcutIgnore|) to ignore a single
        insertion. The next pair character you insert will be inserted
        literally, and auto-pairs will immediately be re-enabled.

        This is effectively equivalewnt to the toggle option, but with fewer
        steps.

2. Conflicting keybinds                                    *autopairs-conflicts*

There may be other reasons and solutions for conflicting keybinds than what's
laid out here; this aims to be a general overview of a few known conflicts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. European letters                               *autopairs-european-letters*

Note: We now have |g:AutoPairsCompatibleMaps|. By setting it to 0, all
mappings will use a control-based alternative instead of the meta variants
inherited from jiangmiao. This will be the default behavior in the future.

Auto-pairs has several mappings that uses the alt key (meta) in such a way
that it conflicts various European letters, including å.
This one specifically originates from Alt-E, which is used by
|g:AutoPairsShortcutFastWrap| when using compatible mode.

While this is a known conflict, there could always be other conflicts.
To see if there's a conflict with a key on your keyboard,
`verbose imap <insert letter>` and see what it says.
See: https://vi.stackexchange.com/q/20995/21251. You should be
able to backtrace the keybind from there, and using the options discussed in
|autopairs-conflicts|, remap it to something else.

From issues on the original autopairs repo, however, it's abundantly clear
that this isn't specific to Scandinavian languages: a few of the meta keybinds
directly conflict with various letters for other European languages. Normally,
this wouldn't be a problem, but in insert mode mappings? They, to say the
least, introduces challenges.

Again, using |g:AutoPairsCompatibleMaps| lets you avoid issues where a meta
combination results in a letter you need. While I highly recommend using
|g:AutoPairsCompatibleMaps|, you can still manually remap the problematic
keys.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Other plugins                                  *autopairs-conflict-plugins*

There's relatively little to do about conflicts with other plugins.

This plugin tries its best to make sure it doesn't override other mappings, by
"importing" other maps, but these may still occur. Auto-pairs' mappings are
done on a per-buffer basis, so it can be compatible with certain other
plugins, but it can also not.

If you find yourself in a situation where you're unable to make sure enter does
what you want, you can always write a function and map <cr> to that. However,
thanks to plugins being weird, you may have to disable bits that remap <cr> for
this to work at all.

Pull requests/issues~
If you read any of this and you can tell me I'm wrong, and offer a solution or
a start, either as a pull request or as an issue, please do let me know. I'm
more than willing to hear alternative solutions to this problem that cause
less inconvenience for the users.

3. Uninstalling                                         *autopairs-uninstalling*

In most cases, uninstalkling is trivial, and doesn't need any other steps than
being removed from your plugin manager, and cleaned from your system. (Or
similar steps if you're not using a plugin manager).

However, there are certain exceptions. If you're having a hard time
uninstalling, this section may explain why.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1. Views                                           *autopairs-uninstall-views*

If you use |:mkview| to save folds or other data, you may have trouble
uninstalling. See:
* https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs/issues/192
* https://github.com/LunarWatcher/auto-pairs/issues/33

Views, with the default settings for |viewoptions|, saves maps for buffers.
Since auto-pairs maps several central keys, this becomes painfully obvious the
second a pair character (or even just space, enter, or backspace) is pressed
after uninstalling.

There's no way for the plugin to "ask" for certain keybinds to be excluded
from saving, which means there's only hackish workarounds.

The general idea is, you need to clean out your view files. The "easiest"
option, if you don't mind losing your data, is deleting |'viewdir'|.
(`:echo &viewdir` to see which directory to delete). Alternatively, you can
manually edit the files, or apply a bit of `sed`/`grep`-magic to get rid of
the offending maps.

If you're looking to just save folds, you can alternatively
`set viewoptions-=options`, which excludes mappings from being saved.
Unfortunately, this won't help you load the view files - they're still going
to be in a broken state. However, it'll prevent the same type of problems from
happening with this or other plugins, as well as from happening on view files
updated after the option is set.

TL;DR:~
Won't fix, but remove the folder defined by |'viewdir'|, or remove the
auto-pairs maps from the files in said directory. `set viewoptions-=options`
helps prevent this problem from occurring, but won't fix any existing view
files.
