COMPATIBILITY STATUS
Poor (requires hacks)

Description~
Auto-pairs is mostly compatible with vim-visual-multi (VM). This fork also
sets up config to make sure the plugin is correctly disabled and respects the
plugin as far as it can. However, that's also the problem.

VM overrides keybinds, and doesn't try to map them in a way that's compatible
with other maps. While there are keys like that in auto-pairs wrt. other
plugins (and some times vice versa), VM gives plugins a way out.

There are, admittedly, ways to retain compatibility by re-enabling keybinds in
a compatible way after the fact, but this breaks jumping, at least wrt. the
cursor position. With the specifics of what's required for compatibility being
vague, the implementation details are unclear and therefore not implemented.

That being said, due to the use of keybinds that do conflict with the plugin,
such as |<cr>| and potentially others, depending on various mapping details,
VM may produce warnings. It's adviced that you suppress these, as they're
unavoidable at the time of writing. The warnings may be suppressed with: >
    let g:VM_show_warnings = 0
<

Note, however, that VM only outputs warnings (at the time of writing), meaning
it makes no practical difference.

COMPATIBILITY STATUS
Poor (bug in nvim; requires hacks)

Description~
Auto-pairs doesn't work in Telescope, by design. The same goes for terminal
buffers in Vim and Neovim.

This is largely down to these buffers not triggering the autocmd, but also
because these types of buffers often end up being inappropriate to run in.
There's different keybinds from regular insert mode, and there's often another
use where automatic pair insertion can end up being detrimental rather than
useful.

While explicitly enabling in terminal buffers is potentially a matter for
later discussion (and a togglable feature), newer versions of Nvim 0.5.0 don't
give you a choice with Telescope. Due to a bug related to autocmds[1],
BufEnter and BufWinEnter are triggered before the filetype can be correctly
set[2]. The consequence of this is that there's also no way to disable
auto-pairs in Telescope using the filetype blacklist[2], as the filetype
blacklist actually requires the filetype to be set.

This behavior isn't present in 0.4.3 and up to (and including) commit 03b3ff8
in neovim 0.5.0. After that commit, Telescope misbehaves due to the
aforementioned bug, which means that auto-pairs is started long before it
should. Again, the consequences of this is that auto-pairs ends up in a state
it's not meant to be in. The workaround hack is to set an autocmd that
disables auto-pairs when the filetype is set. Note, however, that keybinds are
at this point set, which may have unintended consequences. >
